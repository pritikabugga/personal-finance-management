# Assembly Implementation of Stencil Program

## Overview

The main task was to translate a provided C program, `stencil.c`, into RISC-V assembly. The primary focus of the assignment was to implement the core functionality of the program using loops in assembly language. However, I chose to extend the project by including string handling and output, which was not required by the assignment and is not typically covered in the curriculum.

## Assignment Requirements

- **Objective**: Translate the C program `stencil.c` into RISC-V assembly.
- **Focus**: Implement loops and array manipulation in RISC-V assembly.
- **Scope**: The task did not require implementing string handling or the `printf` functionality, as these were considered outside the scope of the course.

## Going Beyond the Assignment

### String Handling in Assembly

While the assignment only called for the creation of loops and basic array operations, I decided to challenge myself by incorporating string handling and output in RISC-V assembly. This was not part of the curriculum, but I wanted to explore how strings and I/O operations work at a low level.

### Brief Solution Overview

- **Loop Implementation**: The core functionality of the `stencil.c` program, involving loops and array operations, was successfully translated into RISC-V assembly.
- **String Handling**: I added additional code to handle strings and output them using environment calls, which required a deeper understanding of how the RISC-V architecture handles memory and system calls.

## Conclusion

By going beyond the basic requirements of the assignment, I was able to explore more advanced topics in assembly language, such as string manipulation and I/O operations. This experience has enhanced my understanding of low-level programming and demonstrated my ability to take on additional challenges beyond the classroom.
